        "to illustrate the ability of algorithms to cope with multimodal data.\n",
        "\n",
        "For each dataset, 15% of samples are generated as random uniform noise. This\n",
        "proportion is the value given to the nu parameter of the OneClassSVM and the\n",
        "contamination parameter of the other outlier detection algorithms.\n",
        "Decision boundaries between inliers and outliers are displayed in black\n",
        "except for Local Outlier Factor (LOF) as it has no predict method to be applied\n",
        "on new data when it is used for outlier detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `sklearn.svm.OneClassSVM` is known to be sensitive to outliers and\n",
        "thus does not perform very well for outlier detection. This estimator is best\n",
        "suited for novelty detection when the training set is not contaminated by\n",
        "outliers. That said, outlier detection in high-dimension, or without any\n",
        "assumptions on the distribution of the inlying data is very challenging, and a\n",
